          <h2> Taste of the Wild Grain </h2>
          <p> The Taste of the Wild Grain-free range is designed to reflect the local, regional produce available all over North America. So, the High Prairie variety contains a mix of buffalo, lamb, bison, and venison. As well as plant-based foods including sweet potatoes and a variety of berries. Frankly, those ingredients sound better than the way most humans eat.</p>
          <p> It is high in protein and low in carbohydrates, following the "biologically appropriate" model of dog feeding. This product is 100 percent grain-free, though this doesn't necessarily make it better for your dog unless they have an allergy.</p>
          <ul>
            Pros
            <li>Extremely high-quality ingredients</li>
            <li>Biologically appropriate </li>
            <li> Contains a good range of vegetables and pulses, as well as meat </li>
            <li> Grain-free (which may be a pro if your dog can't tolerate grains</li>
            <li> 70 percent meat content </li>
          </ul>
          <h2> Castor and Pollux Organix Grain-Free</h2>
          <p> If you prefer to buy organic food for you and your family, you can include your furry family members on the list now, too. Made from predominantly certified organic ingredients and hormone-free meat, this quality dry kibble won't leave you worried about the effects of pesticides on your pet.</p>
          <p> This is a popular food for a reason, and tends to get top reviews from almost everyone who has fed it to their dogs. It also offers good value for money, especially if you order it in larger bags.</p>
          <p>It's made using chicken as a single type of meat, which can be easier on some dogs' stomachs than having a blend of meats. It also contains fish, in the form of salmon meal, and some vegetarian sources of protein, including peas and egg.</p>
          <p> Healthy carbohydrates come from brown rice, barley and millet. Fruits and vegetables including broccoli, carrots and apples add some vitamins and minerals, but this food also contains chelated vitamins and minerals, which are easily absorbed and will make sure your dog is getting all the nutrients they need.</p>
          <ul>
            Pros
            <li> Contains certified organic ingredients</li>
            <li> Hormone-free meat</li>
            <li> Contains chelated vitamins and minerals </li>
            <li> Good value for money</li>
            <li> Large breed formula</li>
          </ul>
          <h2> Wellness Core Large Breed Formula</h2>
          <p> In terms of meat products, it contains a mixture of chicken and turkey, which are easy on the stomach and suit a good range of dogs</p>
          <p> Then there are a large number of plant-based foods, providing both protein and a variety of vitamins and minerals. These ingredients include potatoes, spinach, broccoli, parsley, kale, apple, blueberries and sweet potatoes.</p>
          <p> The large breed formula contains both glucosamine and chondroitin, which are beneficial for the joints and could help avoid some of the joint issues often found in golden retrievers and other big dogs</p>
          <ul>
            Pros
            <li> A range of meat and plant ingredients</li>
            <li>Vitamins and minerals are chelated</li>
            <li> Large breed formula contains glucosamine and chondroitin for joint health</li>
