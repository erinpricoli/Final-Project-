              <p>We love roadtrips, hiking and camping – traveling with Fido is lots of fun!  For those outdoor adventure trips, we have some favorites that we use for an awesome experience.</p>

          <h1> Outdoor Hiking Favorites </h1>
			<h3> Car Hammock </h3>
			<p> We always travel with the car hammock, both for our car and rental cars. If you are renting a car, it’s a good idea to bring a lint roller too!</p>
			<h3> Portable Bowl & Water Bottle </h3>
			<p> Keeping your pup hydrated is important during those long hikes!  You have two options for portable water bowls: silicone or fabric.  We prefer the fabric bowls because these can be folded into any shape. We use the P.L.A.Y collapsible bowl.</p>
			<h3> Dog Saddle Pack</h3>
			<p> The more you can have your pup carry, the less strain you’ll put on your back by carrying their things. Most full grown dogs can carry up to 25% of their body weight, so for Calvin that is 15 pounds. We like the Ruffwear Webmaster Pro Harness (Size Medium) and the OneTigris Saddle Bag for Calvin to carry his things and our water. For a cheaper version of the Ruffwear Harness, check out the Outward Hound Alternative</p>
			<h3> Booties</h3>
			<p> Boots are a must for protection against the elements – snow/salt, sharp rocks, heat. We have heard great things about the Ruffwear Booties, but started out with the cheaper alternative. The cheaper boots lasted about 4 hikes before ripping so we upgraded to Ruffwear.  The cheaper booties probably would have held up nicely if we had only used them for walking in the city. Be sure to get exact paw measurements so the boots don’t slip off.  We sized down for our second pair and they fit perfectly.</p>
			<h3> Outdoor Toys </h3>
			<p> Last, but not least, we always make sure to bring Calvin’s outdoor toys with us.  He has a great bumper and disc that we carry with us every time we travel.  We keep these toys hidden away until we travel so that he is even more excited to see them.  The key to outdoor toys is for them to be easy to clean, we have put these through the washing machine without any damage. </p>
