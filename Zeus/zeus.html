          <h1> How To Use Dog Treats Correctly in Dog Training </h1>
          <h3> Why Use Food Rewards During Training?</h3>
          <p> Despite what we like to believe, dogs don’t actually do the things we ask just to make us happy. That isn’t enough of a reward for most dogs. In reality, they do what works for and benefits themselves.</p>
          <p> If a dog performs a behavior that leads to good things, they’re more likely to repeat it. If it doesn’t lead to good things, they’re less likely to repeat it. It’s that simple.</p>
          <p> So if you want your dog to regularly and reliably work for you, to follow your cues and commands, you have to make it rewarding for them to do so. But what rewards can you offer?</p>
          <p> Some dogs will work for praise – if they find it rewarding enough. Others will work for play – if they find it rewarding enough. Almost all dogs however will work food.</p>
          <h3> Characteristics of Good Training Treats</h3>
          <h6> Small and Easily Eaten</h6>
          <p> For training purposes, you want the treats to be small and easily swallowed, needing little chewing so you can reward with the mantra ‘quickly, little and often’.</p>
          <p> A big slab of rawhide will NOT be conducive to effective training! With big pieces, your dog has to stop, chew and take time to eat it so the pause in training is too long and they lose concentration.</p>
          <p> Perfect treats are relatively soft and about the size of a pea. Dogs aren’t too concerned about the size of the treat, they’re more impressed by the number they get.</p>
          <h2>How To Use Treats In Your Dog Training</h2>
          <p> Once you’ve discovered a treat or two your dog gets excited about, it’s time to get down to the actual training.</p>
          <p>We’ve talked about what not to do (bribery), now let’s focus on what we should be doing when using treats during dog training.</p>
          <p>These next few tips should set you on the right path to using dog treats as an effective tool and is the most important information in this article.</p>
          <h3>Start Using Them With a New Puppy</h3>
          <p>Food treats are at their most effective during the initial stages of training a new puppy.</p>
          <p>For their first few training sessions, before you and they have built up confidence in the training process and a working relationship, other forms of reward such as praise, play or a walk just aren’t ‘real enough’. They aren’t a clear enough incentive to work for as it isn’t something a puppy can see.</p>
          <p>However, food is a physical thing with some substance so it’s far more clear to a puppy what they are working for and they will be far more motivated to work with you. A classic example of this is ‘lure and reward’ training.</p>
          <h3>Don’t Treat Too Much!</h3>
          <p> When learning a new command and behavior for the first time, it pays to reward your puppy or dog with a single food treat every single time they correctly perform the behavior.</p>
          <p> However, you must be cautious about over-rewarding during training.</p>
          <p>ot only will the treats lose some of their magical appeal to your canine companion if they get them every time, but you don’t want your pup to unknowingly pack on poundage through the extra food intake.</p>
          <p>Hartz recommends that you don’t allow treats to make up more than 10 percent of your dog’s daily food intake and it’s a number I’ve seen around often so it’s reasonable advice to follow</p>
