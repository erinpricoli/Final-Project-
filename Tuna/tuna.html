          <p> These dogs have been rescued and adopted by PetswithDisabilities.org. Several had been rehomed and returned to the shelter, others were just unwanted due to their disability. We have made the decision that this will be their last stop. We we will care for these dogs and cats for the remainder of their lives. Here is a highlight of six amazing special dogs </p>

      <p class="card-text">	Sandy was abandoned after her person died.  Neighbors rallied around her but no one wanted her.   Finally an older retired gentleman stepped in to help her and ask us to help her find a forever home. Sandy is true  survivor.  Her vertebra is fused. She was most likely hit by a car with no treatment, as a result her back end is not always in sync with her front end. </p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Pierce</h5>
      <p class="card-text">PIERCE came to PWD in March 2009 after spending the first 3 years of his life trapped in a shelter kennel.  He, along with dozens of other dogs were held for 3 years, pending an animal cruelty court case in PA.  During this time, they had no time outside, no human interaction, dogs were in-breeding because they couldn't be vetted - it was awful.  The last 6 months of the court case, a wonderful group of volunteers were allowed into the shelter to help socialize the dogs - and once the case was settled - helped get them out!  </p>

      <p class="card-text">We rescued Hank from our friends at Regional Animal Shelter. Hank lost his paw, most likely from hunting trap, and now has become our first candidate for a fitted prosthetic.  He loves his "new paw" and each day he feels more comfortable running on all 4 legs again.We all love his  positive canine energy, it’s totally contagious… It was fun to see Hank realize what a home is all about, dog beds, biscuits, never ending toys, and a love!</p>
